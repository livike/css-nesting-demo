# CSS nesting

Examples are taken from this article: https://developer.chrome.com/articles/css-nesting/

Comment and uncomment  nested selectors in the nesting.practice layer: ```@layer nesting.practice {}```

The demo code contains many other cool new css features as: CSS variables, :has() peudo class and layers.

Note how you can import an external css exclusively into a layer (style.css lines 5,6)

In the primary article you can see usecase for :is() and :not() pseudo classes, for nesting media queries and you can learn about nesting rules and nesting selectors.

The demo uses the newly released super light, flexible and customisable CSS library by Adam Argyle [@argyleink](https://twitter.com/argyleink): [OpenProps](https://open-props.style/) [@openprops](https://twitter.com/openprops)
